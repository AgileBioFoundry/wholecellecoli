[Slot COMMENT in Peroxiredoxins changed
from   ("|FRAME: Peroxiredoxins Peroxiredoxins| are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes that have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine or Cp) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE \"hydrogen peroxides\"|, |FRAME: Alkyl-Hydro-Peroxides \"alkyl hydroperoxides\"|, and |FRAME: CPD0-1395 peroxynitrites|.

Depending on the specific peroxiredoxin enzyme, reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE|, |FRAME: Thioredoxin thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Glutaredoxins glutaredoxin|, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.

The first peroxiredoxin was identified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| in 1987 and named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA), because it was thought to remove reactive sulfur species rather than reactive oxygen species |CITS: [2895105]|. The correct functional assignment was made after the discovery of AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [2191951]|.

All peroxiredoxins contain an L-cysteine residue that attacks the substrate (Cp) and becomes hydroxylated during the catalytic cycle. There are two classification systems for the peroxiredoxins, one based on the mechanism for the reduction of the hydroxylated Cp residue, and the other based on sequence analysis.

According to the first classification system, the enzymes can categorized into three classes based on the location or absence of a second L-cysteine residue (C<sub>R</sub>) that is involved in restoring Cp to its reduced state. The three classes are:

1. The |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"2-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| (also called typical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins) are homodimeric and contain two conserved (Cp and C<sub>R</sub>) cysteine residues per subunit. The Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the other subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide.

2. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins \"Atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins\"| are monomeric, and the Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the same subunit, forming an intrasubunit disulfide. Members of this class can use thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin as the reductant |CITS: [12913160]|. A subtype is the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins \"Q-type peroxiredoxins\"|, which are homologs of the |FRAME: EG10108| (bacterioferritin co-migrating protein) of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [10998352]|.

3. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"1-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine |CITS: [8914536]|. Given the absence of a C<sub>R</sub>, Cp&ndash;SOH of 1-Cys enzymes cannot be resolved within the peroxiredoxin molecules and instead forms a disulfide with a cysteine residue provided by other proteins or small thiol molecules |CITS: [20919932]|.

According to the second classification system, which was introduced in 2011 based on sequence analysis of more than 3500 enzymes, the enzymes are divided into six classes -  AhpC-Prx1 (identical to the typical 2-Cys class), BCP-PrxQ (named after the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10108| and plant |FRAME: AT3G26060|), Tpx (named for the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: G6660|), Prx5 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: HS05016-MONOMER|), Prx6 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: CPLX-9416|, sometimes referred to as the 1-Cys group), and AhpE (named for |FRAME: TAX-1773| AhpE) |CITS: [21287625]|.

Mammalian cells express six peroxiredoxins - PrxI to PrxIV are 2-Cys, PrxV is an atypical 2-Cys, and PrxVI is 1-Cys |CITS: [11795591]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| expresses five peroxiredoxins -  Tsa1 and Tsa2 are two 2-Cys, Ahp1 and nTpx are atypical 2-Cys, and mTpx is 1-Cys |CITS: [26813659]|. The plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| expresses nine peroxiredoxins.")

[Slot COMMENT in Glycogens changed
from   ("Glycogen is a highly branched glucose polymer that serves as a form of energy storage in archaea, bacteria, and eukaryotes. It resembles plant-produced |FRAME: Starch starch| and is sometimes called \"animal starch\".

Glycogen is formed of small chains of 8 to 12 glucose molecules linked together by &alpha; (1->4) bonds. These small chains, also known as |FRAME: Maltodextrins maltodextrins|, are in turn linked together by &alpha; (1->6) bonds. The &alpha;-1,4 linkages make up approximately 95% of the total molecule.  The &alpha;-1,6 branches accounts for 7&ndash;10% of the linkages and are evenly distributed within the glycogen particle.

Since each chain (with the exception of the outer unbranched chains) supports two branches, glycogen particles grow spherically by adding tiers (a tier corresponds to the spherical space separating two consecutive branches from all chains located at similar distance from the center of the particle). Mathematical modelling predicts a maximal value for the particle size above which further growth is impossible, as there would not be sufficient space for interaction of the chains with the catalytic sites of glycogen metabolism enzymes. The predicted upper limit is a particle consisting of 12 tiers corresponding to a 42 nm maximal diameter and including about 55,000 glucose residues. 36% of this total number rests in the outer (unbranched) shell and is thus readily accessible to glycogen catabolism without the need for debranching |CITS: [12179957]|.

Although glycogen and starch are two distinct physical states of the same type of storage polysaccharide, starch is solid semi-crystalline while glycogen particles are entirely hydrosoluble |CITS: [21220783]|.")

Since each chain (with the exception of the outer unbranched chains) supports two branches, glycogen particles grow spherically by adding tiers (a tier corresponds to the spherical space separating two consecutive branches from all chains located at similar distance from the center of the particle).

Two structural levels of glycogen particles have been reported, which are tightly associated with their physiological functions: small quasi-spherical &beta; particles, as found in muscle cells, and large rosette-shaped &alpha; particles, as found in liver cells. The diameter of &beta; particles normally range from 10 to 50 nm, with an average at around 20&mdash;30 nm. The &beta; particles can stick together to form large &alpha; particles with diameters up to
300 nm |CITS: [20196533][31244022][33996916]|. Two types of &alpha; particles have been observed: fragile and dense particles, which comprise large and dense &beta; particles with long average chain length, and stable light particles, which comprise smaller, compact &beta; particles with short average chain length |CITS: [31244022]|.

Mathematical modelling predicts a maximal size for the &beta; particle beyond which further growth is impossible, as there would not be sufficient space for interaction of the chains with the catalytic sites of glycogen metabolism enzymes.

[Slot COMMENT in glycyl-tRNAAla changed
from   ("|FRAME: All-tRNAs \"A transfer RNA\"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.

There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.

The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 

The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA<sup>Ala</sup> molecule misacylated by aglycyl group.")

from   ("This term should not be used for direct annotation. The only exception should be when experimental data (e.g., staining with trypan blue or propidium iodide) show that cell death has occurred, but fail to provide details on death modality (accidental versus programmed). When information is provided on the cell death mechanism, annotations should be made to the appropriate descendant of 'cell death' (such as, but not limited to, GO:0097300 'programmed necrotic cell death' or GO:0006915 'apoptotic process').

[Slot COMMENT in 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins changed
from   ("|FRAME: Peroxiredoxins Peroxiredoxins| are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.

Depending on the peroxiredoxin enzyme, reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.

The first peroxiredoxin was identified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| in 1987 and named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA), because it was thought to remove reactive sulfur species rather than reactive oxygen species |CITS: [2895105]|. The correct functional assignment was made after the discovery of AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [2191951]|.

All peroxiredoxins contain an L-cysteine residue that attacks the substrate (Cp) and becomes hydroxylated during the catalytic cycle. There are two classification systems for the peroxiredoxins, one based on the mechanism for the reduction of the hydroxylated Cp residue, and the other based on sequence analysis.

According to the first classification system, the enzymes can categorized into three classes based on the location or absence of a second L-cysteine residue (C<sub>R</sub>) that is involved in restoring Cp to its reduced state. The three classes are:

1. The |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"2-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| are homodimeric and contain two conserved (Cp and  C<sub>R</sub>) cysteine residues per subunit. The Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the other subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide.

2. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins \"Atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins\"| are monomeric, and the Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the same subunit, forming an intrasubunit disulfide. Members of this class can use thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin as the reductant |CITS: [12913160]|. A subtype is the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins \"Q-type peroxiredoxins\"|, which are homologs of the |FRAME: EG10108| (bacterioferritin co-migrating protein) of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [10998352]|.

3. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"1-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine |CITS: [8914536]|. Given the absence of a C<sub>R</sub>, Cp&ndash;SOH of 1-Cys enzymes cannot be resolved within the peroxiredoxin molecules and instead forms a disulfide with a cysteine residue provided by other proteins or small thiol molecules |CITS: [20919932]|.

According to the second classification system, which was introduced in 2011 based on sequence analysis of more than 3500 enzymes, the enzymes are divided into six classes -  AhpC-Prx1 (identical to the typical 2-Cys class), BCP-PrxQ (named after the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10108| and plant |FRAME: AT3G26060|), Tpx (named for the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: G6660|), Prx5 (named for the mammalian Prx5), Prx6 (named for the mammalian Prx6, sometimes referred to as the 1-Cys group), and AhpE (named for Mycobacterium tuberculosis AhpE) |CITS: [21287625]|.

Mammalian cells express six peroxiredoxins - PrxI to PrxIV are 2-Cys, PrxV is an atypical 2-Cys, and PrxVI is 1-Cys |CITS: [11795591]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| expresses five peroxiredoxins -  Tsa1 and Tsa2 are two 2-Cys, Ahp1 and nTpx are atypical 2-Cys, and mTpx is 1-Cys |CITS: [26813659]|. The plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| expresses nine peroxiredoxins.")
to     ("|FRAME: Peroxiredoxins Peroxiredoxins| are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes that have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine or Cp) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include |FRAME: HYDROGEN-PEROXIDE \"hydrogen peroxides\"|, |FRAME: Alkyl-Hydro-Peroxides \"alkyl hydroperoxides\"|, and |FRAME: CPD0-1395 peroxynitrites|.

Depending on the specific peroxiredoxin enzyme, reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on |FRAME: GLUTATHIONE|, |FRAME: Thioredoxin thioredoxin|, |FRAME: Glutaredoxins glutaredoxin|, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.

The first peroxiredoxin was identified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| in 1987 and named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA), because it was thought to remove reactive sulfur species rather than reactive oxygen species |CITS: [2895105]|. The correct functional assignment was made after the discovery of AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [2191951]|.

All peroxiredoxins contain an L-cysteine residue that attacks the substrate (Cp) and becomes hydroxylated during the catalytic cycle. Multiple classification systems have been suggested for the peroxiredoxins, based on the mechanism for the reduction of the hydroxylated Cp residue and on sequence analysis.

According to an earlier classification system, the enzymes were categorized into three classes based on the location or absence of a second L-cysteine residue (C<sub>R</sub>) that is involved in restoring Cp to its reduced state. The three classes are:

1. |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"2-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| (also called typical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins) are homodimeric and contain two conserved (Cp and C<sub>R</sub>) cysteine residues per subunit. The Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the other subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide.

2. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins \"Type II peroxiredoxins\"|, (also called atypical 2-Cys-peroxiredoxins), are monomeric, and the Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the same subunit, forming an intrasubunit disulfide. Members of this class can use thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin as the reductant |CITS: [12913160]|. A subtype is the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins \"Q-type peroxiredoxins\"|, which are homologs of the |FRAME: EG10108| (bacterioferritin co-migrating protein) of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [10998352]|.

3. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"1-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine |CITS: [8914536]|. Given the absence of a C<sub>R</sub>, Cp&ndash;SOH of 1-Cys enzymes cannot be resolved within the peroxiredoxin molecules and instead forms a disulfide with a cysteine residue provided by other proteins or small thiol molecules |CITS: [20919932]|.

In later publications the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins \"Q-type peroxiredoxins\"| are considered a separate 4th class |CITS: [15890615][18493039]|.

According to the second classification system, which was introduced in 2011 based on sequence analysis of more than 3500 enzymes, the enzymes are divided into six classes -  AhpC-Prx1 (identical to the typical 2-Cys class), BCP-PrxQ (named after the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10108| and plant |FRAME: AT3G26060|), Tpx (named for the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: G6660|), Prx5 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: HS05016-MONOMER|), Prx6 (named for the mammalian |FRAME: CPLX-9416|, sometimes referred to as the 1-Cys group), and AhpE (named for |FRAME: TAX-1773| AhpE) |CITS: [21287625]|.

Mammalian cells express six peroxiredoxins - PrxI to PrxIV are 2-Cys, PrxV is an atypical 2-Cys, and PrxVI is 1-Cys |CITS: [11795591]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| expresses five peroxiredoxins -  Tsa1 and Tsa2 are two 2-Cys, Ahp1 and nTpx are atypical 2-Cys, and mTpx is 1-Cys |CITS: [26813659]|.

from   NIL
to     ("CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotes that are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the organism. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. CRISPR sequences are found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea |CITS: [29522745]|.

CRISPR sequences are utilized by CRISPR-associated systems (Cas). A complex of Cas proteins (called Cascade) cuts the |FRAME: Pre-crRNAs \"CRISPR RNA precursor\"| within the repeats into mature RNA molecules called |FRAME: crRNAs CRISPR RNA\"| (crRNA), which remains bound to the Cascade complex. Other Cas proteins are DNA or RNA nucleases. The complex guides tthose enzymes to its target (bacteriophage necleic acid), which is then cleaved |CITS: [22745249]|.

By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, an artificial Cas9 system can be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage, making CRISPR a powerful tool for <i>in vivo</i> genetic engineering |CITS: [24136345][27401123]|.

Some Cas systems, such as Cas-9, require an additional small RNA, known as <i>trans</i>-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) for activity |CITS: [21455174]|. Other systems, such as Cas-12a, do not require tracrRNA |CITS: [28646112]|. Some systems, such as Cas9 and Cas13a, are DNA-specific, while other systems, such as Cas13, target single-stranded RNA |CITS: [27256883]|.")

[Slot COMMENT in 16S-rRNAs changed
from   ("The 16S ribosomal RNA is the RNA component of the 30S small subunit of the prokaryotic ribosome. The 3' end of the 16S rRNA contains the anti-Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which binds upstream to the AUG start codon on the mRNA. The 3'-end also binds to the S1 and S21 proteins, which are involved in initiation of protein synthesis.

The gene encoding the 16S rRNA is used as the standard for building philogenetic trees for the classification and identification of microbes.

[Slot COMMENT in CPD-19766 changed
from   ("|FRAME:CPD-19766 Coenzyme F430| is a nickel containing tetrapyrrole cofactor that is present in all methanogenic
bacteria. It was initially observed in 1977 by Jean LeGall in extracts of |FRAME: TAX-145262|. The name factor 430 (F430) was coined by Gunsalus and Wolfe who reported the absorbance maximumat 430 nm |CITS: [Gunsalus78]|. The compound belongs to the corphins, a class of compounds that combine structural elements of both |FRAME: Corrins corrins| and |FRAME: Porphyrins porphyrins| |CITS: [Eschenmoser86]|.

In 1982 Ellefson et al showed that |FRAME:CPD-19766| is a cofactor of the enzyme |FRAME: EC-2.8.4.1| (methyl-coenzyme M reductase) |CITS: [6954513]|. This enzyme catalyzes the final step of methane production in all methanogenic bacteria: the reduction of the methyl group in |FRAME: Me-CoM| to |FRAME:CH4|.

F430 exists in two distinct intracellular pools: either bound to methyl-CoM reductase or free of protein in the cytosol. Early literature on F430 was confusing due to reports of heterogeneity in F430 samples that depended on the isolation and purification procedures used in different laboratories. Later work showed that F430 exists primarily in two isomeric forms. These forms differ in the relative stereochemical disposition of acid side chains at positions 12 and 13 |CITS: [3356701]|.

The biosynthetic route leading to |FRAME: PWY-5196| was discovered only in 2016 |CITS: [27846569]|.")

from   ("|FRAME: All-tRNAs \"A transfer RNA\"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.

There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.

The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group of the aminoacyl-adenylate to the 2' or 3' terminal OH of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes).

The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA<sup>asp</sup> molecule misacylated with a D-aspartyl group.")

[Slot COMMENT in L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL changed
from   NIL
to     ("The structure of |FRAME: L-1-PHOSPHATIDYL-GLYCEROL phosphatidylglycerol| (PG) was determined  in 1958 from lipid isolates of single-cell green algae from the |FRAME: TAX-3087| genus |CITS: [13510267]|. Its structure is analogous to phosphatidylinositol (PI), but with a glyceryl moiety replacing the inosityl moiety of PI. 

Within a decade it has been found in higher plants |CITS: [Benson61]|, Gram-negative bacteria |CITS: [4868364][4295332]| and mammals |CITS: [5660098]|. It was later discovered in the archaeon |FRAME: TAX-2246|, indicating that it is produced by all three domains of life. The biosynthetic pathway was elucidated in the early 60s |CITS: [14033231]|, and a laboratory synthesis was completed a few years later |CITS: [5916374]|.

The abundance of PG is relatively low compared with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in prokaryotes or with either PE or phosphatidylcholine (PC) in eukaryotes |CITS: [18216768][20671299][21172818]|. It is typically more concentrated in plant systems than in animals, forming 1.5-4&middot;5% of the lipid fraction |CITS: [23532185][3592680]|

Since its discovery, biochemical research into PG has been dominated by its roles in the surfactant of lung tissue (PG is the second largest lipid constituent of lung surfactant in almost all mammals), chloroplast membranes (PG is the only phospholipid found in chloroplast thylakoids) and in both bacterial and mammalian systems.")

to     ("This compound stands for a mixture of |FRAME: CPD-16564| and |FRAME: CPD-16565|. In most cases, each of these compounds mutarotates quickly to form a mixture of the two, and thus it is the general rule to use this non-specific form in reactions unless it is specifically known that an enzyme can accept only one of the forms.")

While it is well-known for its role in methanogenesis, factor 420 has also been found in various eubacteria of the actinobacteria class, such as Streptomyces, Rhodococcus, Nocardioides, and Mycobacterium, where it assists in the synthesis of antibiotics like tetracycline and lincomycin.

[Slot COMMENT in D-Glucose changed
from   ("D-Glucose is an extremely abundant monosaccharide that is used as an energy source in most organisms, from bacteria to humans. In humans D-glucose is the key source of energy, through aerobic respiration, but other organisms can also metabolize glucose by anaerobic respiration and fermentation.

D-Glucose is also one of the main products of photosynthesis, and is used as a precursor for the synthesis of several important substances, such as cellulose and chitin. Many organisms store glucose as an energy and carbon reserve in the form of polymers such as  starch and glycogen.

In addition, D-glucose is often added onto certain proteins and lipids through glycosylation, which is often critical for their functioning.

Each aldopentose or aldohexose exists as a mixture of at least six compounds: the aldehyde, the hydrated aldehyde
(gem-diol), the two pyranoses, and the two furanoses. The open-chain structure shown here is provided only as a schematic illustration of chirality. Consult the appropriate class instances for information on specific ring structures and their anomeric configuration. At 37&deg;C the distribution of the different glucose tautomers is as follows |CITS: [Maple87]|:

[Slot COMMENT in D-Tryptophanyl-tRNA-Trp changed
from   ("|FRAME: All-tRNAs \"A transfer RNA\"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.

There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.

The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 

The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA<sup>Trp</sup> molecule misacylated by a D-tryptophanyl group.")

to     ("CRISPR (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats) are DNA sequences found in the genomes of prokaryotes that are derived from DNA fragments of bacteriophages that had previously infected the organism. They are used to detect and destroy DNA from similar bacteriophages during subsequent infections. CRISPR sequences are found in approximately 50% of sequenced bacterial genomes and nearly 90% of sequenced archaea |CITS: [29522745]|.

CRISPR sequences are utilized by CRISPR-associated systems (Cas). A complex of Cas proteins (called Cascade) cuts the |FRAME: Pre-crRNAs \"CRISPR RNA precursor\"| within the repeats into mature RNA molecules called |FRAME: crRNAs CRISPR RNA\"| (crRNA), which remains bound to the Cascade complex. Other Cas proteins are DNA or RNA nucleases. The complex guides tthose enzymes to its target (bacteriophage necleic acid), which is then cleaved |CITS: [22745249]|.

By manipulating the nucleotide sequence of the guide RNA, an artificial Cas9 system can be programmed to target any DNA sequence for cleavage, making CRISPR a powerful tool for <i>in vivo</i> genetic engineering |CITS: [24136345][27401123]|.

Some Cas systems, such as Cas-9, require an additional small RNA, known as <i>trans</i>-activating CRISPR RNA (tracrRNA) for activity |CITS: [21455174]|. Other systems, such as Cas-12a, do not require tracrRNA |CITS: [28646112]|. Some systems, such as Cas9 and Cas13a, are DNA-specific, while other systems, such as Cas13, target single-stranded RNA |CITS: [27256883]|.")

[Slot COMMENT in 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins changed
from   ("|FRAME: Peroxiredoxins Peroxiredoxins| are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.

Depending on the peroxiredoxin enzyme, reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.

The first peroxiredoxin was identified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| in 1987 and named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA), because it was thought to remove reactive sulfur species rather than reactive oxygen species |CITS: [2895105]|. The correct functional assignment was made after the discovery of AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [2191951]|.

All peroxiredoxins contain an L-cysteine residue that attacks the substrate (Cp) and becomes hydroxylated during the catalytic cycle. There are two classification systems for the peroxiredoxins, one based on the mechanism for the reduction of the hydroxylated Cp residue, and the other based on sequence analysis.

According to the first classification system, the enzymes can categorized into three classes based on the location or absence of a second L-cysteine residue (C<sub>R</sub>) that is involved in restoring Cp to its reduced state. The three classes are:

1. The |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"2-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| are homodimeric and contain two conserved (Cp and  C<sub>R</sub>) cysteine residues per subunit. The Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the other subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide.

2. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins \"Atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins\"| are monomeric, and the Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the same subunit, forming an intrasubunit disulfide. Members of this class can use thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin as the reductant |CITS: [12913160]|. A subtype is the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins \"Q-type peroxiredoxins\"|, which are homologs of the |FRAME: EG10108| (bacterioferritin co-migrating protein) of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [10998352]|.

3. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"1-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine |CITS: [8914536]|. Given the absence of a C<sub>R</sub>, Cp&ndash;SOH of 1-Cys enzymes cannot be resolved within the peroxiredoxin molecules and instead forms a disulfide with a cysteine residue provided by other proteins or small thiol molecules |CITS: [20919932]|.

According to the second classification system, which was introduced in 2011 based on sequence analysis of more than 3500 enzymes, the enzymes are divided into six classes -  AhpC-Prx1 (identical to the typical 2-Cys class), BCP-PrxQ (named after the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10108| and plant |FRAME: AT3G26060|), Tpx (named for the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: G6660|), Prx5 (named for the mammalian Prx5), Prx6 (named for the mammalian Prx6, sometimes referred to as the 1-Cys group), and AhpE (named for Mycobacterium tuberculosis AhpE) |CITS: [21287625]|.

Mammalian cells express six peroxiredoxins - PrxI to PrxIV are 2-Cys, PrxV is an atypical 2-Cys, and PrxVI is 1-Cys |CITS: [11795591]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| expresses five peroxiredoxins -  Tsa1 and Tsa2 are two 2-Cys, Ahp1 and nTpx are atypical 2-Cys, and mTpx is 1-Cys |CITS: [26813659]|. The plant |FRAME: TAX-3702| expresses nine peroxiredoxins.

The class of typical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins is both the largest and the most widely distributed, with members found in archaea, bacteria, and all classes of eukaryotes. Members of this subfamily include the bacterial AhpC proteins, tryparedoxin peroxidases, plant Prxs including Arabidopsis thaliana 2-Cys Prxs and barley Bas1, the yeast TSA1 and TSA2 proteins, and human PrxI, II, III, and IV.

Members of the AhpC-Prx1 subfamily have been linked with important roles in cellular signaling and some appear to be regulated by phosphorylation |CITS: [15890005][20178744]|.")

The inverted m7G, which is also known as a cap0 structure, marks transcription start sites, and has multiple effects on gene expression, including enhancement of RNA stability, splicing, nucleocytoplasmic transport and translation initiation, as facilitated by interactions with nuclear and cytoplasmic cap binding proteins.

The cap0 structure is present on all eukaryotic mRNAs and is essential for cell growth of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and survival of mammalian cells |CITS: [21310715]|.")

Most of the fucose found in biology is in the |FRAME: L-fucoses \"L conformation\"|, and the use of |FRAME: D-Fucoses| is rather rare (for example in some |FRAME: Cardenolide-Glycosides \"cardenolide glycosides\"|).

Small ncRNAs such as |FRAME: miRNAs microRNAs| (miRNAs) can suppress translation, degrade mRNA and epigenetically silence targeted loci |CITS: [23175680]|. Additional classes of small ncRNAs can act similarly to miRNAs or can modulate cellular processes such as ribosome biogenesis.

from   ("|FRAME: Peroxiredoxins Peroxiredoxins| are a ubiquitous family of antioxidant enzymes which have been identified in eubacteria, archaea, yeast, algae, higher plants, and animals |CITS: [12714747]|. All peroxiredoxins share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which an activated cysteine (the peroxidative cysteine) is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. They have a rather low activity, but possess a broad substrate specificity. Substrates for peroxiredoxins include hydrogen peroxides, alkyl hydroperoxides, and peroxynitrites.

Depending on the peroxiredoxin enzyme, reductive regeneration of the oxidized catalytic thiol depends on glutathione, thioredoxin, glutaredoxin, cyclophilin, and/or tryparedoxin |CITS: [16284092]|.

The first peroxiredoxin was identified in |FRAME: TAX-4932| in 1987 and named thiol-specific antioxidant (TSA), because it was thought to remove reactive sulfur species rather than reactive oxygen species |CITS: [2895105]|. The correct functional assignment was made after the discovery of AhpC (alkyl hydroperoxide reductase) in |FRAME: TAX-90371| |CITS: [2191951]|.

All peroxiredoxins contain an L-cysteine residue that attacks the substrate (Cp) and becomes hydroxylated during the catalytic cycle. There are two classification systems for the peroxiredoxins, one based on the mechanism for the reduction of the hydroxylated Cp residue, and the other based on sequence analysis.

According to the first classification system, the enzymes can categorized into three classes based on the location or absence of a second L-cysteine residue (C<sub>R</sub>) that is involved in restoring Cp to its reduced state. The three classes are:

1. The |FRAME: 2-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"2-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| are homodimeric and contain two conserved (Cp and  C<sub>R</sub>) cysteine residues per subunit. The Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the other subunit to form an intersubunit disulfide.

2. |FRAME: Type-II-Peroxiredoxins \"Atypical 2-Cys peroxiredoxins\"| are monomeric, and the Cp&ndash;SOH that is formed during the catalytic cycle reacts with the C<sub>R</sub> of the same subunit, forming an intrasubunit disulfide. Members of this class can use thioredoxin and/or glutaredoxin as the reductant |CITS: [12913160]|. A subtype is the |FRAME: Q-Type-Peroxiredoxins \"Q-type peroxiredoxins\"|, which are homologs of the |FRAME: EG10108| (bacterioferritin co-migrating protein) of |FRAME: TAX-562| |CITS: [10998352]|.

3. |FRAME: 1-Cys-Peroxiredoxins \"1-Cys-peroxiredoxins\"| contain a single conserved catalytic cysteine |CITS: [8914536]|. Given the absence of a C<sub>R</sub>, Cp&ndash;SOH of 1-Cys enzymes cannot be resolved within the peroxiredoxin molecules and instead forms a disulfide with a cysteine residue provided by other proteins or small thiol molecules |CITS: [20919932]|.

According to the second classification system, which was introduced in 2011 based on sequence analysis of more than 3500 enzymes, the enzymes are divided into six classes -  AhpC-Prx1 (identical to the typical 2-Cys class), BCP-PrxQ (named after the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: EG10108| and plant |FRAME: AT3G26060|), Tpx (named for the |FRAME: TAX-562| |FRAME: G6660|), Prx5 (named for the mammalian Prx5), Prx6 (named for the mammalian Prx6, sometimes referred to as the 1-Cys group), and AhpE (named for Mycobacterium tuberculosis AhpE) |CITS: [21287625]|.

Mammalian cells express six peroxiredoxins - PrxI to PrxIV are 2-Cys, PrxV is an atypical 2-Cys, and PrxVI is 1-Cys |CITS: [11795591]|. The yeast |FRAME: TAX-4932| expresses five peroxiredoxins -  Tsa1 and Tsa2 are two 2-Cys, Ahp1 and nTpx are atypical 2-Cys, and mTpx is 1-Cys |CITS: [26813659]|.

from   ("|FRAME: All-tRNAs \"A transfer RNA\"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.

There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.

The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 

The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA<sup>Tyr</sup> molecule misacylated with a D-tyrosyl group.")

[Slot COMMENT in RUBISCO changed
from   ("The carboxylation of |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2|, which is catalyzed by |FRAME: EC-4.1.1.39|, is the primary event in the photosynthetic carbon fixation. In the presence of oxygen, the enzyme can also catalyze the oxygenolysis of |FRAME: D-RIBULOSE-15-P2|, yielding  |FRAME: G3P| and |FRAME: CPD-67|. The two reactions are called the photosynthetic and photorespiratory reactions, respectively, and can occur simultaneously and in competition at the same active site, giving the enzyme its common name ribulose 1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (RuBisCO) |CITS:[SchlegelBowien]|.

There are four types of enzymes in the RuBisCO superfamily.

All higher plants, cyanobacteria and most eukaryotic algae possess type I enzymes, hexadecamers of eight large and eight small subunits (see |FRAME:CPLX-105| from |FRAME: TAX-1148| for an example).

Type II enzymes are generally found as dimers of large subunits, and are found in some photosynthetic proteobacteria, chemoautotrophic bacteria and some dinoflagellate algae  (see |FRAME:CPLX-7446| from |FRAME: TAX-1085| for an example). Both types I and type II enzymes catalyze the capture of |FRAME: CARBON-DIOXIDE| into an organic carbon form as part of the |FRAME:CALVIN-PWY \"Calvin-Benson-Bassham (CBB) cycle\"|.

Type III enzymes are found in archaea, and are capable of carbon fixation, even though these organisms do not have a CBB cycle. They are dimeric (see |FRAME:CPLX-7442| from |FRAME: TAX-311400| for an example).

Type IV enzymes are missing some crucial residues, and are not able to catalyze carbon fixation. They are also dimeric, and have been shown to participate in methionine salvage (see |FRAME: CPLX-7445| from |FRAME: TAX-1423| and |FRAME: CPLX-8607| from |FRAME: TAX-1085| for examples).")

from   ("Siderophores are small, high-affinity iron chelating compounds usually produced and secreted by microorganisms. Once outside the cell, siderophores bind |FRAME: FE+3| with high affinity, and the iron-siderophore complexes are imported back into the cell by active-transport mechanisms.

Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.

Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores \"catechols\"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores \"hydroxamates\"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores \"thiazolines\"|.

Some grasses are known to make siderophores as well. These |FRAME: Phytosiderophores \"phytosiderophores\"| are also known as mugineic acids.")
to     ("Although iron is extremely abundant on Earth, its solubility is very low at physiological pH in aerobic environments. While iron(II) is souble, it is rapidly oxidized in the presence of oxygen into insoluble ferric oxyhydroxides. In addition, iron is often complexed with organic molecules. The concentration of free iron in body fluids is estimated to be about 10<sup>-18</sup> M |CITS: [12655062]|. The most common iron uptake mechanism used by microorganisms are ferrisiderophore acquisition systems.

Siderophores are small organic compounds with a very high affinity for iron. Once secreted into the environment, siderophores efficiently solubilize and chelate iron(III). The iron-siderophore complexes (ferrisiderophores) are imported back into the cell by specific transport systems, crossing both the outer and inner membranes |CITS: [23046646]|. Once in the cytoplasm (and in some cases, in the periplasm), iron is released from siderophores by hydrolysis, proton-assisted dissociation of the complex, or reduction of the metal center |CITS: [23443998]|.

Siderophores are very common in pathogenic bacteria, since iron in the host organism is usually tightly bound to proteins, resulting in an extremely low concentration of free iron in the blood.

More than 500 different siderophores have now been identified. The most common siderophore use hydroxamate and/or catechol functions, attached to either linear or cyclic scaffolds, to form a hexadentate structure. Siderophore with lower denticity (tetradentate, tridentate, and bidentate) are also produced, but have a much lower affinity toward iron(III). In general, all siderophores possess a higher affinity for iron(III) than for iron(II) |CITS: [20376388]|.

Most siderophores belong to one of three major groups: the |FRAME: Catecholate-siderophores \"catechols\"|, |FRAME: Hydroxamate-siderophores \"hydroxamates\"| and |FRAME: Thiazoline-siderophores \"thiazolines\"|. Other groups include |FRAME: Phenolate-Siderophores \"phenolate siderophores\"| and |FRAME: Carboxylate-siderophores \"carboxylate siderophores\"|. Many siderophores contain more than one type of functional groups.

Some grasses are known to make siderophores as well. These |FRAME: Phytosiderophores \"phytosiderophores\"| are also known as mugineic acids.")

from   ("|FRAME: All-tRNAs \"A transfer RNA\"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.

There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.

The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 

The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-prolyl group bound to the terminal 3'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562| and yeast |CITS: [17206069]|.")

from   NIL
to     ("Nearly all forms of RNA are post-transcriptionally modified on the nucleobases or ribose, including the 5'-terminal caps on messenger (mRNA) and other RNAs.

The canonical cap on most eukaryotic and viral mRNAs is in the form m<sup>7</sup>GpppX (e.g. |FRAME: m7G5-pppR-mRNAs cap0|, |FRAME: m7G5-pppRm-R-mRNAs cap1|, and |FRAME: m7G5-pppRm-Rm-mRNAs cap2|). The m<sup>7</sup>GpppX cap has several important biological functions, including protection of mRNA from degradation by 5'-exoribonucleases, direction of pre-mRNA splicing and nuclear mRNA export, facilitation of recognition by eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E, and regulation of various aspects of mRNA fate and function, including mRNA stability and mRNA translation |CITS: [27317694]|.

A variety of non-canonical caps involving nucleotide metabolites have also been described, including NAD, dephospho-coenzyme A (dpCoA) |CITS: [26779928][29544676]|, FAD, UDP-glucose, and UDP-<i>N</i>-acetylglucosamine |CITS: [28531287][31504804]|.

NAD 5'-capped RNAs have been observed in bacteria |CITS: [25533955]|, yeast |CITS: [28031484]|, plants |CITS: [31142655][31142650]| and mammals .

Prokaryotic RNA polymerases can use NAD in place of ATP at the 5' end during transcription initiation |CITS: [27383794]|. In contrast, NAD capping of post-transcriptionally processed intronic small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) in mammalian cells is an alternative mechanism of a post-transcriptional NAD capping |CITS: [28283058]|.

In |FRAME: TAX-562| the NAD cap protects RNA from 5' end degradation |CITS: [25533955]|, whereas in mammals the NAD cap serves as a mark to degrade the RNA. Degradation begins with the DXO NAD cap decapping enzyme, followed by 5'-3' exoribonuclease activities |CITS: [28283058]|.")

[Slot COMMENT in Plant-Arabinogalactans-II changed
from   ("Arabinogalactans (AGs) are widely spread throughout the plant kingdom. Many edible and inedible plants are rich sources of these polysaccharides. AGs are associated with the pectin cell-wall component by physical bonds, and some of them are covalently linked to the complex pectin molecule as neutral side chains |CITS: [Ebringerova05]|.

AGs have been classified into two general forms, named |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-I \"type I\"| and |FRAME: Plant-Arabinogalactans-II \"type II\"|. AGs of type I have a linear &beta;-(1&rarr;4)-D-Gal<i>p</i> backbone, while those of type II have a &beta;-(1&rarr;3)-D-Gal<i>p</i> backbone.

In type II AGs, known also as arabino-3,6-galactan, the (&beta;-1&rarr;3)-D-Gal<i>p</i> backbone is heavily substituted at position 6 by mono- and oligosaccharide side chains composed of arabinosyl and galactosyl units. It is more widespread than the AG type I and occurs in cell walls of dicots and cereals often linked to proteins (known as arabinogalactan proteins). AG type II, along with galactomannans and cellulose, comprises the predominating polysaccharides of green arabica coffee beans |CITS: [11217967]|. In some case type II AG contains a small amount of &beta;-glucuronate.

AG type II occurs as minor, water-soluble components in softwoods. It is very abundant in the wood of larch trees (members of the genus |FRAME: TAX-3325|) - certain parts of the western larch (|FRAME: TAX-3327|) contain up to 35% AG |CITS: [Whistler93]|. Larch AG type II is located in the lumen of the tracheids and ray cells, and is thus not a cell-wall component and by definition, not part of the |FRAME: Hemicelluloses| of these trees.

The glycan structure shown here is adapted from |CITS: [24966860]|.")

[Slot COMMENT in Cys-tRNA-Pro changed
from   ("|FRAME: All-tRNAs \"A transfer RNA\"| (tRNA) is an adaptor molecule made out of RNA that serves as the physical link between the nucleotide sequence of nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) and the amino acid sequence of proteins.

There are many tRNAs, most of which are specific for a particular amino acid. Each tRNA binds its amino acid and contains a three-nucleotide sequence called the anticodon, which forms three base pairs with a matching codon in mRNA during protein biosynthesis.

The amino acid is covalently attached to the 3'-end of the tRNA, which ends with a CCA motif. More specifically, the amino acid is first activated by a dedicated aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) to an adenylate form, followed by a transfer of the aminoacyl group to the 2' or 3' hydroxyl group of the terminal ribose of the tRNA. Based on the active site structure, AARSs are grouped into two independently evolved classes |CITS: [2203971]|. In general, class I and II enzymes attach amino acyl groups to the 2'- and 3'-OH groups, respectively |CITS: [1103137][319826]|. However, in solution the 2'- or 3'-linked amino acids spontaneously transacylate to the neighboring OH at high rates, resulting in a mixture of 2'- and 3'-linked AA-tRNA isomers |CITS: [Griffin66]|. 

The bound amino acid is then delivered to the ribosome by proteins called elongation factors (EF-Tu in bacteria, eEF-1 in eukaryotes). The elongation factors stabilize the 3'-isomer, which is preferred by the ribosome during peptide bond formation.

The structure shown here depicts the CCA motif at the 3' end of the tRNA molecule with an L-prolyl group bound to the terminal 3'-OH group, as is the case in |FRAME: TAX-562| and yeast |CITS: [17206069]|.")
to     ("L-cysteinyl-[tRNA<sup>Pro</sup>] is formed when |FRAME: EC-6.1.1.15|, misacylates tRNA<sup>Pro</sup> with |FRAME: CYS| |CITS: [12130657]|.")

from   ("Polysaccharide capsules are ubiquitous structures found on the cell surface of a broad range of bacterial species. They are thick, mucous-like, layers of polysaccharides that form a cap around the bacterial surface.They are an important factor in the virulence of many animal and plant pathogens, where they protect the bacteria from opsonophagocytosis and complement-mediated killing by the host.

Capsular polysaccharides are linear and consist of regularly repeating subunits of one to six monosaccharides. They have molecular weights on the order of 100-2000 kDa, and are linked to the cell surface of the bacterium via covalent attachments to phospholipids, lipid-A molecules, or peptidoglycan. The composition allows for a remarkable variability - over 80 different capsular polysaccharides (also known as K antigens) have been described for |FRAME: TAX-562| alone.

Capsular polysaccharides are highly hydrated, and consist of over 95% water. 

Biosynthesis and assembly of capsular polysaccharides is a complex process. In Gram-negative bacteria the activated precursors (nucleotide monophospho and diphospho sugars) are assembled in the cytoplasm into the nascent polysaccharide by enzymes associated with the inner membrane, and while attached to the membrane by an undecaprenyl membrane anchor. A dedicated translocation pathway moves the nascent polymer through the periplasm and across the outer membrane to the cell surface, where it is removed from the membrane anchor and attached to the core oligosacchride of lipid A.")
